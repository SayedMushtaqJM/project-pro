            <p>A huge mess with a dining hall, kitchen, ice cream parlor, and other facilities are provided to students and staff. The mess hall accommodates about 2500 students at a time. Food is prepared hygienically. Separate seating arrangements are made for girls and boys, based as well on eating preference i.e., vegetarians and non vegetarians. Sweet or ice cream is served everyday for all the students. Breakfast and tea are also served in front of class room blocks before the starting of classes at 8 a.m.</p><p>

                For the students who attend special classes in the evening after the regular classes, tea and snacks are served.
                
                All the visitors to the college, teaching and non-teaching staff take breakfast, lunch and evening snacks in the dining hall at no cost.</p><p>The problem of holiday hunger among children has gathered substantial attention in 2020, given the impact of Covid-19 on financially weak families. It is estimated that 3 million children face food poverty in the UK. In London alone, around 700,000 children face hunger during school holidays due to lack of free school meals, according to the Mayor of London's 2018 report.</p><p>

                Childhood hunger leads to profound adverse outcomes in terms of long-term physical, educational, and financial achievements. With so many people in crisis, The Akshaya Patra Foundation UK felt that it was necessary to utilise its unique perspective and experience and apply this to the UK scenario.</p>
