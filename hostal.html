                education and enjoyment. The JIT campus offers to both the day scholars and residents a complete suite
                of facilities that are very self-sufficient. </p>
            <p>Thus, the student has absolutely no need to step out of the college premises for anything. It goes that
                extra mile to make the life of students staying at hostels that much more comfortable and pleasant,
                thereby making it second home. The college provides excellent and separate hostel facilities for both
                boys and girls. The students are provided spacious rooms with attached bath with running hot and cold
                water.</p>
            <p> Subscribing to the fact that student need to have fresh air combined with physical sport it offers
                spacious and large play courts /playground for volleyball, basketball, shuttle, ball badminton and other
                outdoor games.</p>
            <p>A hostel is a place where usually students live and which is supervised by an administration and living
                in those hostels is called the hostel life. Hostels are aimed at providing budget-oriented, sociable
                accommodation for students.</p>
            <p> In a hostel, usually a bunk bed, in a dormitory and share a bathroom, lounge and a kitchen or a mess are
                provided. Rooms are usually single-sex, although private rooms may also be available for the students
                who are studying doctorate or PhD level in universities. </p>
            <p>Hostels are generally aimed at providing an economical and healthy environment for the students that is
                also safe for them. In a hostel room, it is very important to take care with personal belongings, as
                other students may share a common living space and things that look alike, so it is advisable to secure
                your belongings. Most hostels offer some sort of system for safely storing valuables and an increasing
                number of hostels offer private lockers.</p>
            <p>

                It has been observed that there is less privacy in a hostel room for students as compared to their stay
                at home, PG or in a private room than in a hotel. </p>
            <p>Hostels encourage more social interaction between the students due to the shared sleeping areas and
                communal areas such as lounges, kitchens and internet cafes. Hostels have provision for gymnasium where
                the hostellers can take morning exercise and building their bodies. There are a reading room and library
                attached to the hostel to enable the students to study books, newspapers and computer Internet. In a
                nutshell, the hostel not only cares for the health of the students but also their studies.</p>
